   - Check the Render logs
   - Verify environment variables
   - Ensure requirements.txt is complete
   - Check Python version compatibility

2. If you can't log in:
   - Verify ADMIN_PASSWORD environment variable
   - Clear browser cache and cookies
   - Check application logs for auth errors

3. If changes don't deploy:
   - Manually trigger a deploy in Render dashboard
   - Check deployment logs for errors
   - Verify Git repository connection
